### personal CV and portfolio web app
monorepo containing frontend, backend and serverless functions 

## why this repo exists
### version control 
keep record of my evolving personal CV and portfolio web app
### show project lifecycle management
demonstrate my approach to living projects eg. planning / design / architecture / phase management / delivery etc
### show devops capabilities
demonstrate my understanding of the use of ci / cd capabilities and infrastructure as code for managing project updates and releases

## why a monorepo
### single developer
a monorepo means i can build a distributed solution that i can easily evolve into a more complex multi-service architecture without having to manage multiple repositories or deal with the complexities of coordinating multiple codebases
### leaky microservices
even the best micro-services architectures using containerisation can leak business logic and result in distributed monolith architectures; a single repository makes it easier to correct the bounded contexts when the need arises
### reader-friendly
the primary goal of this project is to showcase my approach to web development and delivery; a monorepo makes the distributed nature of a multi-service architecture more reader-friendly
