### Personal CV and Portfolio Web App
A monorepo containing frontend, backend, and serverless functions 

## Why This Repo Exists
### Version Control 
To keep a record of my evolving personal CV and portfolio web app.

### Show Project Lifecycle Management
To demonstrate my approach to living projects, e.g., planning, design, architecture, phase management, delivery, etc.

### Show DevOps Capabilities
To demonstrate my understanding of CI/CD capabilities and infrastructure as code for managing project updates and releases.

## Why a Monorepo
### Single Developer
A monorepo allows me to build a distributed solution that I can easily evolve into a more complex multi-service architecture without having to manage multiple repositories or deal with the complexities of coordinating multiple codebases.

### Leaky Microservices
Even the best microservices architectures using containerization can leak business logic and result in distributed monolith architectures. A single repository makes it easier to correct the bounded contexts when the need arises.

### Reader-Friendly
The primary goal of this project is to showcase my approach to web development and delivery. A monorepo makes the distributed nature of a multi-service architecture more reader-friendly.
